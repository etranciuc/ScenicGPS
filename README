This project was developed by Jack Reilly & Dan Lynch at UC Berkeley. 

The Scenic Routing app will be used to present scenic options for routes that users choose. Routes will given a scenic score and travel time. The scenic score will be calculated based on amount of social and geo-coded content from providers such as You Tube, Panaramio, Twitter, etc. Users will be able to learn about nearby scenic interest points while traveling along route, and have content dynamically pop as they pass along the point (the passenger should be interacting with this, however). The server will generate scenic routes (or detours) based on not only dynamically generated content, but from our database of highly scenic destinations or points of interest. The user can also contribute geo-tagged content along their route by taking photos and videos. The project will utilize a traffic network system created by CCIT (California Center for Innovative Transportation), and with supplemental routing from Google Maps.
